# Payflow: Onchain Social Payments Ecosystem

**Payflow is an onchain social payments ecosystem on a mission to solve payment fragmentation across a common social layer shared by different apps.**

**The social layer can be built on platforms like Farcaster, ENS, Lens, and other social data available onchain (e.g., Telegram usernames are already onchain). Currently, Payflow is focused on Farcaster integration.**

**Payflow is not just a wallet; itâ€™s an ecosystem of embeddable payment tools that can easily be plugged into:**
- **Feeds**
- **Chats**
- **Standalone apps**

## Solving Payment Fragmentation

**In the rapidly evolving landscape of decentralized applications (dApps), users face significant challenges in managing payments across various social primitives. Existing solutions lack seamless integration between these platforms, leading to:**
- **Fragmented user experiences**
- **Complex payment workflows**
- **Limited interoperability between chains and tokens**

**As a result, users struggle with discovering and managing their assets.**

## Developer Solutions

**For developers of other dApps, the burden of developing their own payment solutions results in:**
- **Duplicated efforts**
- **Increased development time**
- **Resource constraints**

**Payflow addresses these challenges by providing an onchain social payments ecosystem that can be easily integrated based on underlying common social primitives.**
